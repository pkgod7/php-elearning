DO..WHILE - DO..WHILE loops are useful for things that want to loop at least once. Notice that the condition is tested at the end of the block instead of the beginning, so the block will be executed at least once. If the condition is true, we jump back to the beginning of the block and execute it again. A do..while loop is almost the same as a while loop except that the loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once. A while loop says Loop while the condition is true, and execute this block of code, a do..while loop says Execute this block of code, and then continue to loop while the condition is true.
